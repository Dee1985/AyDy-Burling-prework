// Using JavaScript, compute the following:

//1. The product of 9 and 9
console.log("The product of 9 and 9 = ", 9 * 9);

//2. The quotient of 56 and 12
console.log("The quotient of 56 and 12 = ", 56 / 12);

//3. The remainder of 281 divided by 9
console.log("The remainder of 281 divided by 9 = ", 281 % 9);

//4. 18 divided by 0
console.log("18 divided by 0 = ", 18 / 0);

//5. The sum of string 56 and string 92
//without parseInt
console.log("The sum of string 56 and string 92 = ", "56" + "92");

//with parseInt
console.log(
  "the sum of string 56 and string 92 after converting to numbers= ",
  parseInt("56", 10) + parseInt("92", 10)
);

//6. Using any comparison operator you wish on the numbers 42 and 52, make it evaluate to false.
console.log("Is 42 greater than 52?", 42 > 52);
