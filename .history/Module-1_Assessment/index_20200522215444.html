											Cheers! I am a full stack developer and a Registered
											Nurse. I have over 15+ years experience in an acute care
											setting at a Level 1 trauma center. With my vast and
											unique medical background, I am interested in combining
											the "art of nursing" with the skills that I have acquired
											as a web developer, to create meaningful user/client
											experiences.
										</p>
										<p>
											Fun Facts: In my free time, I love to explore the world!
											Paris, Rome, London, Athens, Belize, Cambodia (just to
											name a few)... I crave cultural experiences- especially
											the food! Hiking and camping are probably my most favorite
											activities. I have a National Parks passport book that, I
											sadly admit, needs more stamps and stickers... but gloomy
											days spent watching horror movies or reading a good book
											are also ways that I like to pass the time. I also enjoy
											pinball and games (table-top, console, pc), "Catan
											anyone?"
										</p>
										<p>
											Odds & Ends: I will say that I enjoy good company, and
											being adventurous, but I'm actually quite an introvert and
											maybe because of that, I can come off as being a bit
											tepid. However, the hardest lesson I am learning (as more
											learning experiences come with age) is acceptance of
											myself- all of my "self". These days I attempt to cherish
											the times when I am my own good company. The occasions
											when I can sing off key as loudly as I want at home, going
											to a movie or restaurant alone, the early morning hot cup
											of coffee while the world around me is still not quite
											awake, or sometimes just sitting in solitude on a park
											bench... I have learned that these moments during my day,
											these times in my life when there are less distractions,
											are just as important as cultivating relationships and
											pushing the boundaries of my introverted self.
