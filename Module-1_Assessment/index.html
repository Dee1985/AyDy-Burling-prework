                      Cheers! I am a full stack developer and a Registered
                      Nurse. I have over 15+ years experience in an acute care
                      setting at a Level 1 trauma center. With my vast and
                      unique medical background, I am interested in combining
                      the "art of nursing" with the skills that I have acquired
                      as a web developer, to create meaningful user/client
                      experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Fun Facts: In my free time, I love to explore the world!
                      Paris, Rome, London, Athens, Belize, Cambodia (just to
                      name a few)... I crave cultural experiences- especially
                      the food! Hiking and camping are probably my most favorite
                      activities. I have a National Parks passport book that, I
                      sadly admit, needs more stamps and stickers... but gloomy
                      days spent watching horror movies or reading a good book
                      are also ways that I like to pass the time. I also enjoy
                      pinball and games (table-top, console, pc), "Catan
                      anyone?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Odds & Ends: I will say that I enjoy good company, and
                      being adventurous, but I'm actually quite an introvert and
                      maybe because of that, I can come off as having a tepid
                      disposition. However, the hardest lesson I am learning (as
                      more learning experiences come with age) is acceptance of
                      myself- all of my "self". These days I attempt to cherish
                      the times when I am my own good company. The occasions
                      when I can sing off key as loud as I want at home, going
                      to a movie or restaurant alone, the early morning hot cup
                      of coffee while the world around me is still not quite
                      awake, or sometimes just sitting in solitude on a park
                      bench... I have learned that these moments during my day,
                      these times in my life when there are less distractions,
                      are just as important as cultivating relationships and
                      pushing the boundaries of my introverted self.
